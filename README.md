# Weather? Bruh.
A project I decided to make in order to practice using APIs and giving them a proper user interface. Weather? bruh. is an application that can be used to grab the weather, temperature and time of a city. All you need to do it input the name of the city.

## Info
* Uses the OpenWeatherMap API for data.
* Uses the Bing Search API for images.
